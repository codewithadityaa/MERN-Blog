# MERN-Blog
MERN Blog - A Full Stack React.js and Node.js Blogging Application

A comprehensive MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack project for creating a feature-rich blog website. This project includes a functional React.js front end with React Router Dom for navigation and a Node.js back end providing RESTful API endpoints for blog management, all powered by MongoDB as the database.

Currently done with the front-end part and shortly going to start back-end with node.js, mongoDB and express.
